In this project I am following javascript30.com to have a deep knowledge of Javascript. 

I make the project first by watching the video lecture.

Then I am starting a new Project which uses the same way with the previous Project but it is something different.
I am trying to add something and change something if I can. 

The projects from website are called as J30-1, J30-2 and so on. 

My projects are called with the suffix yearmfew. For example J30-1-yearmfew.
